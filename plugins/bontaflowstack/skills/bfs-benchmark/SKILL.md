# BFS Benchmark

Load [HOST.md](../../HOST.md) via `read bfs-benchmark`; follow its hash-based read protocol.
Modes: `quick`, `baseline`, `compare`, `trend`. Use quick for one sample, baseline to save measurements, compare against a baseline, and trend to read stored series. Default: `quick`.

1. Select the pages and measurement mode. Quick uses one labelled sample; a baseline or comparison uses three samples under equivalent conditions.
2. Record browser, viewport, cache, network, authentication and revision when known. Diff-aware coverage comes from an explicit base and verified changed pages.
3. Read real navigation, paint and resource entries through engine browser perf or js. Serialize entries with toJSON when needed.
4. Calculate TTFB from responseStart minus requestStart; retain interactive/load timings, FCP, request counts and observable transfer sizes. Measure LCP with a buffered PerformanceObserver and a bounded wait. Missing measurements remain unknown.
5. Report medians for repeated samples and compare only matching coverage and conditions. A zero baseline produces an unavailable percentage, not infinity. Apply user budgets first; otherwise label a suggested threshold as a heuristic.
6. Save raw samples and a report to the agreed project directory. Only an explicit baseline operation replaces the selected baseline, preserving its previous copy.
7. Check calculations against samples.

A local browser measurement is not field Core Web Vitals evidence. Trend mode reads compatible stored measurements without starting a browser or modifying the application.

Output: Raw samples, checked calculations, report path, slow resources, verified regressions and investigation hypotheses.
